This is a Django web app that allows you to merge your Google Drive and Dropbox accounts to access your files in one place.

No need to keep track of which accounts have what data.  OStore will auto manage your data and display it all in one place for easy access.

Add as many Google Drive and Dropbox accounts for essentially unlimited amount of space. Simply add files to OStore and you won't have to worry about which accounts have what data.

Maybe your Dropbox and Google Drive each only have 1 GB of space left but you have a photo library that is 2 GB.  You can upload it as 1 folder and view it as one folder through OStore but the files will be spread over your two accounts.

This application is perfect for those who don't care which of their cloud storage spaces are being used, just that they can access their data in one place.
